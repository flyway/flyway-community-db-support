# Flyway Community DB Support

This repository was created to simplify open source contributions to the databases that Flyway supports.
Supported databases in this repository will be released as part of Flyway. 

## Contributing

Want to add support for a new database? [See our contributing docs for more information](https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd/flyway-community-database-support-233445293.html).

## Versioning

Plugins are versioned independently of Flyway itself. 
The version will be increased appropriately after merging changes to this repo. 
When using these modules, their versions won't necessarily need to match the version of Flyway they're being used with.
